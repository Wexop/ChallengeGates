# Challenge Gates

The Company is testing a new teleportation system: Challenge Gates.
Each gate transports employees into a room with a challenge to complete.
Complete it, earn extra credits, fail... and die.

Ready ?

Only one player can go into a challenge, when a player enter he must complete it to escape. The gate is closed after a player enter the room. A trophy spawn close to escape door, the value of this trophy is high, but decrease with time. Faster you complete the challenge, the more expensive the trophy will be.

This mod have some configs, check them to have a customized experience !
